Ever wondered you can add more value to your search engine!?
Common, who likes a boring page filled with white spaces all the time?
Here you go! 
I have implemented a mechanism to display the Norton Security product's health in Norton Safe Search Home Page!

Key Notes :

1. Used a simple owl caroussel to swing the data collected at the bottom
2. Used a Counter to display the number with swag


Here are the before and after pictures
